The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider utilises a trigger system consisting of
a first level hardware trigger and a higher level software trigger. The Level-1 Muon Barrel
Trigger is one of the main elements for the event selection of the ATLAS experiment. It
exploits the Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) detectors to generate the trigger signal. The
RPCs are arranged in three concentric double layers and operate in a strong magnetic
toroidal field. RPC detectors cover the pseudo-rapidity range |Î·| < 1.05 for a total surface
of more than 4000 m^2 and about 3600 gas volumes. The Level-1 Muon Trigger in the
barrel region allows to select muon candidates with respect to their transverse momentum
and associates them with the correct bunch-crossing number. The performance of the
RPC detector system as well as the Muon Barrel trigger performance during the ATLAS
2018 data taking are here presented.
